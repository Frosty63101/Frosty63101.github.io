        <h2 id="header1">Basic Derivitive Rules</h2>
        <p>
            <li>Constant Rule: The derivative of a constant function is always zero. For example, 
                if f(x) = c, where c is a constant, then f'(x) = 0.</li><br>
            <li>Power Rule: The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, where n is a constant, <br>
                then f'(x) = nx^(n-1). This rule applies to functions with a single variable raised to a constant power.</li><br>
            <li>Sum/Difference Rule: The derivative of the sum or difference of two functions is equal <br>
                to the sum or difference of their derivatives. If f(x) = g(x) ± h(x), then f'(x) = g'(x) ± h'(x).</li><br>
            <li>Product Rule: The product rule is used when we need to find the derivative of a function <br>
                that is the product of two other functions. If f(x) = g(x) * h(x), then f'(x) = g'(x) * h(x) + g(x) * h'(x).</li><br>
            <li>Quotient Rule: The quotient rule is used to find the derivative of a function that is the <br>
                ratio of two other functions. If f(x) = g(x) / h(x), where h(x) ≠ 0, then f'(x) = (g'(x) * h(x) - g(x) * h'(x)) / (h(x))^2.</li><br>
            <li>Exponential and Logarithmic Rules: The derivatives of exponential and logarithmic functions have <br>
                specific rules. For example, the derivative of e^x is e^x, and the derivative of ln(x) (natural logarithm) is 1/x.</li><br>
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="header2">Chain Rule</h2>
        <p>
            Chain Rule: The chain rule is applied when we have a composite function, where one function is <br>
            applied as the input of another function. If f(x) = g(h(x)), then f'(x) = g'(h(x)) * h'(x). <br>
            This rule is used to find the derivative of nested functions.<br>
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="header3">Tangent Line Equation</h2>
        <p>
            <li>Find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x, denoted as f'(x). <br>
                This derivative represents the slope of the curve at any given point.</li><br>
            <li>Substitute the x-coordinate of the point of tangency (x₀) into the derivative f'(x) <br>
                to find the slope of the curve at that point. Let's denote this slope as m.</li><br>
            <li>Now we have the slope (m) and a point (x₀, y₀) on the tangent line. <br>
                We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to describe the tangent line:</li><br>
            <li>y - y₀ = m(x - x₀)</li><br>
            <li>This equation represents the equation of the tangent to the curve at the point (x₀, y₀). <br>
                It states that the difference in y-coordinates (y - y₀) is equal to the slope (m) times the difference in x-coordinates (x - x₀).</li><br>
            <li>If desired, you can rearrange the equation to the slope-intercept form (y = mx + b) by simplifying and solving for y:</li><br>
            <li>y = mx + (y₀ - mx₀)</li><br>
            <li>In this form, the equation represents the tangent line in terms of the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b = y₀ - mx₀).</li><br>
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="header4">Trig Derivitives</h2>
        <p>
            <li>Sine Function (sin x): Derivative: cos x</li><br>
            <li>Cosine Function (cos x): Derivative: -sin x</li><br>
            <li>Tangent Function (tan x): Derivative: sec^2 x</li><br>
            <li>Cosecant Function (csc x): Derivative: -csc x * cot x</li><br>
            <li>Secant Function (sec x): Derivative: sec x * tan x</li><br>
            <li>Cotangent Function (cot x): Derivative: -csc^2 x</li><br>
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="header5">Implicit diferentiation</h2>
        <p>
            <li>Start with an equation that relates x and y. For example, let's consider the equation: F(x, y) = 0</li><br>
            <li>Assume that both x and y are functions of the independent variable, often denoted as t. <br>
                So, we can express x and y as x(t) and y(t), respectively.</li><br>
            <li>Apply the chain rule to differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to t. <br>
                This means that for any function f(u), if u is a function of t, then the derivative of f(u) <br>
                with respect to t is given by f'(u) * u'.</li><br>
            <li>For example, differentiating x(t) with respect to t gives x'(t), and differentiating y(t) <br>
                with respect to t gives y'(t).</li><br>
            <li>Differentiate each term of the equation separately, using the chain rule whenever necessary.</li><br>
            <li>For example, if we have the term x^2, differentiating it with respect to t gives 2x * x'(t). <br>
                Similarly, if we have the term y^3, differentiating it with respect to t gives 3y^2 * y'(t).</li><br>
            <li>After differentiating each term, rewrite the equation in terms of x, y, x', and y' only. <br>
                Eliminate the derivative of the independent variable (t) from the equation.</li><br>
            <li>Solve the resulting equation for y' to find the derivative of y with respect to x.</li><br>
            <li>Note that y' represents the derivative of y with respect to the independent variable (t). <br>
                However, once you solve the equation, you'll have an expression for y' in terms of x, y, and x'.</li><br>
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="header6">derivitives of inverse functions</h2>
        <p>
            <li>The derivatives of inverse functions are related to the derivatives of the original functions through a specific formula. <br>
                Let's say we have a function f(x) and its inverse function is denoted by f^(-1)(x).</li><br>
            <li>If f(x) is differentiable at a point x=a and f'(a) ≠ 0, then the inverse function f^(-1)(x) is differentiable at x=b=f(a), <br>
                and its derivative at that point is given by: (f^(-1))'(b) = 1 / f'(a)</li><br>
            <li>In other words, the derivative of the inverse function at a particular point is equal to the reciprocal of the <br>
                derivative of the original function evaluated at the corresponding point.</li><br>
            <li>To illustrate this concept, let's consider an example. Suppose we have the function f(x) = 2x + 3, <br>
                and we want to find the derivative of its inverse function at a particular point.</li><br>
            <li>Step 1: Find the derivative of the original function f(x): f'(x) = 2</li><br>
            <li>Step 2: Find the point where we want to evaluate the derivative of the inverse function, let's say x = 5.</li><br>
            <li>Step 3: Evaluate f'(x) at x = 5: f'(5) = 2</li><br>
            <li>Step 4: Find the corresponding value of f(x) at x = 5: f(5) = 2(5) + 3 = 13</li><br>
            <li>Step 5: Use the formula to find the derivative of the inverse function at x = 13: (f^(-1))'(13) = 1 / f'(5) = 1 / 2 = 0.5</li><br>
            <li>So, the derivative of the inverse function of f(x) = 2x + 3, evaluated at x = 13, is 0.5.</li><br>

        <h2 id="header7">Inverse Trig Functions</h2>
        <p>
            <li>Derivative of arcsin(x): (d/dx) arcsin(x) = 1 / √(1 - x^2)</li><br>
            <li>Derivative of arccos(x): (d/dx) arccos(x) = -1 / √(1 - x^2)</li><br>

            <li>Derivative of arccot(x): (d/dx) arccot(x) = -1 / (1 + x^2)</li><br>
            <li>Derivative of arcsec(x): (d/dx) arcsec(x) = 1 / (|x| √(x^2 - 1))</li><br>
            <li>Derivative of arccsc(x): (d/dx) arccsc(x) = -1 / (|x| √(x^2 - 1))</li><br>

        <h2 id="header8">1d Particle Motion</h2>
        <p>
            The derivitive of position-time is velocity and the derivitive of velocity is acceleration, the derivitive of acceleration is the rate of change of acceleration<br>
            if an object is moving to the right it's motion is positive unless otherwise stated.  If the signs of velocity and acceleration are the same,<br>
            the object is speeding up in the direction of the sign.<br>
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="header9">Related Rates</h2>
        <p>
            <li>Identifying the variables involved: Determine which quantities are changing and which quantities are known.</li><br>
            <li>Establishing the equation or relationship: Use the given information to set up an equation or a geometric relationship that connects the variables involved.</li><br>
            <li>Differentiating the equation with respect to time: Take the derivative of both sides of the equation with respect to time, assuming all variables are functions of time.</li><br>
            <li>Substituting known values: Plug in the given values and the rates of change of the known variables into the derived equation.</li><br>
            <li>Solving for the desired rate of change: Use algebraic manipulation to isolate the unknown rate of change and solve for it.</li><br>
            <li>Interpreting the result: Provide a meaningful interpretation of the obtained rate of change in the context of the problem.</li><br>
            <li>Remember that the derivitive or "'" is the rate of change of the variable</li><br>

        <h2 id="header10">MVT</h2>
        <p>
            <li>the Mean Value Theorem states that if a function f(x) is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on <br>
                the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one value c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of f(x) at c <br>
                is equal to the average rate of change of f(x) over the interval [a, b]. In other words, if f(a) and f(b) are the values of the <br>
                function at the endpoints of the interval, then there exists a point c where the instantaneous rate of change of f(x) at c is equal <br>
                to the slope of the secant line connecting (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)).</li><br>
            <li>The Mean Value Theorem can be expressed mathematically as:</li><br>
            <li>f'(c) = (f(b) - f(a))/(b - a)<br>
                where f'(c) denotes the derivative of f(x) at c.</li><br>
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="header11">Function Analysis w/ Concavity</h2>
        <p>
            <li>Find the second derivative: Differentiate the function f(x) once to obtain its first derivative f'(x), and then differentiate <br>
                f'(x) again to obtain the second derivative f''(x).</li><br>
            <li>Identify critical points: Determine the points where the second derivative is equal to zero or undefined. These points are known <br>
                as critical points and can help us identify potential inflection points.</li><br>
            <li>Test intervals: Divide the domain of the function into intervals using the critical points. For each interval, select a test point and <br>
                evaluate the sign of the second derivative at that point.</li><br>
            <li>a. If the second derivative is positive (+) at the test point, the function is concave upward on that interval.</li><br>
            <li>b. If the second derivative is negative (-) at the test point, the function is concave downward on that interval.</li><br>
            <li>Note: The second derivative being zero at a test point indicates a potential point of inflection, which requires further investigation.</li><br>
            <li>Plotting the results: Based on the signs of the second derivative in different intervals, we can sketch the graph of the function. <br>
            <li>The concave upward regions correspond to U-shaped curves, while the concave downward regions correspond to inverted U-shaped curves.</li><br>
            <li>Points of inflection: If the second derivative changes sign at a specific point within an interval, it is a potential point of inflection. <br>
                To confirm it as a point of inflection, analyze the behavior of the function at that point (e.g., using the first derivative test or higher-order derivatives).</li><br>

        <h2 id="header12">Absolute Extrema</h2>
        <p>
            <li>Identify the interval: Determine the interval or domain over which you want to find the extrema. It could be a closed interval [a, b] or an open interval (a, b).</li><br>
            <li>Find critical points: Critical points are the locations where the derivative of the function is zero or undefined. To find critical points, take the derivative of the function <br>
                and set it equal to zero, then solve for the variables. Also, consider any points where the derivative is undefined, such as vertical asymptotes.</li><br>
            <li>Evaluate the function at critical points: Once you have the critical points, evaluate the function at each of these points and record the corresponding function values.</li><br>
            <li>Evaluate the function at the endpoints: Evaluate the function at the endpoints of the given interval.</li><br>
            <li>Compare the function values: Compare all the function values obtained from steps 3 and 4. The highest function value represents the absolute maximum, and the lowest function value <br>
                represents the absolute minimum over the given interval.</li><br>
