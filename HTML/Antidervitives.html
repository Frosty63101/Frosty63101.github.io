            <h2 id="header1"> Antidifferentiate Sums/Differences of Powers</h2>
            <p>
                Antidifferentiating sums or differences of powers in calculus can be represented using the integral sign (∫) and appropriate notation for the
                function. 
                Here's an example using keyboard characters:<
                <
                ∫(x^n + x^m) dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + (x^(m+1))/(m+1) + C<
                <
                In this expression, ∫ represents the integral, dx represents the variable of integration (often x),
                and C represents the constant of integration.
                The function is given by a sum of two terms, x raised to the power of n and x raised to the power of m.
                To antidifferentiate this expression, each term is raised to the power of its original exponent plus one,
                and then divided by the new exponent plus one. 
                Finally, the constant of integration is added.<
                <
                Note that this notation assumes x is the independent variable and n, m, and C are constants.
            </p>
            
            <h2 id="header2"> Antidifferentiate Radicals</h2>
            <p>
                Antidifferentiating radicals in calculus involves finding the integral of a function containing a radical symbol (√).
                While it's challenging to represent mathematical symbols using only keyboard characters,
                I can provide you with an approximation using commonly available characters.
                Here's a representation of the concept:
                
                ∫ (√(expression)) dx
                
                In this notation, the integral symbol (∫) represents the process of antidifferentiation,
                while the expression within the square root symbol (√) represents the function being integrated.
                The "dx" at the end denotes the variable of integration, which is typically x in calculus.
                
                Please note that this representation is not an exact mathematical notation but serves as a visual approximation using keyboard characters 
            </p>
            
            <h2 id="header3">Definite Integral Using FTC</h2>
            <p>
                The definite integral, as defined by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC), 
                can be represented using keyboard characters as follows:
                
                ∫[a, b] f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)
                
                In this expression,
                <li> "∫" represents the integral symbol,</li><br>
                <li>"[a, b]" denotes the interval of integration from "a" to "b,"</li><br>
                <li> "f(x)" represents the function being integrated,</li><br>
                <li>"dx" signifies the variable of integration,</li><br>
                <li>"F(x)"represents the antiderivative (indefinite integral) of the function "f(x)."</li><br>
                <br>
                The expression "F(b) - F(a)" represents the difference in the values of the antiderivative at the endpoints of the interval,
                which gives the net area under the curve between "a" and "b."
                
            </p>
            
            <h2 id="header4">Definite Integrals with Substitution</h2>
            <p>
                <li>First, let's start with the definite integral symbol: ∫.</li><br>
                <li> To indicate the function being integrated, use a lowercase "f" followed by the variable of integration, usually "x". For example, f(x).
                </li><br>
                <li>Next, you'll need to include the differential "dx" to indicate the variable of integration. Place it right after the function. For example,
                    f(x)dx.</li><br>
                <li>To specify the limits of integration, use square brackets "[" and "]".
                    Inside the brackets, indicate the lower limit of integration on the left and the upper limit on the right,
                    separated by a comma. For example, [a, b]. </li><br>
                <li>Finally, if you're using substitution, you can use a lowercase "u" to represent the new variable. 
                    Place it inside the function and use "du" to indicate the differential of the new variable. For example, f(u)du.</li><br>
                <li>Combining all the elements, a definite integral with substitution can be represented as:</li><br>
                ∫f(x)dx = ∫f(u)du [a, b]
                <li>Remember to replace "f(x)" and "dx" with the appropriate functions and differentials for your specific integral.</li><br>
            </p>
            
            <h2 id="header5">Integrate Algebraic Functions with Substitution</h2>
            <p>
                <li>Start with the integral sign (∫) to indicate that you are finding the antiderivative of a function.<br></li>
                
                <li>Write down the function you want to integrate, using parentheses for clarity.<br></li>
                
                <li> After the function, write "dx" to indicate that you are integrating with respect to x.<br></li>
                
                <li> Use the equal sign (=) to indicate the result of the integration.<br></li>
                
                <li> Inside the integral sign, use a variable of substitution, typically denoted by a letter such as u.<br></li>
                
                <li> After the u-substitution, write the differential for the u-substitution. In this case, du represents the differential of u.<br></li>
                
                <li> Assign the function to u. Replace x in the original function with u-substitution. For example, f(x) becomes f(u) = (3u^2 + 2u + 1).<br>
                </li>
                
                <li> Rewrite dx in terms of du using the substitution. This step may involve rearranging and solving for dx in terms of du.<br> For instance, if
                    x = u^2, then dx = 2u du.<br></li>
                
                <li> Substitute the function and the differential in terms of u into the integral expression. For example, the integral becomes ∫(3u^2 + 2u
                    + 1) * (2u du).<br></li>
                
                <li> Simplify the integrand by expanding and combining like terms if necessary.<br></li>
                
                <li> Integrate the simplified expression with respect to u.<br></li>
                
                <li> Finally, replace the u with the original variable x in the result of the integration.<br></li>

            <blockquote>Horizontal direction: Use a dash (-) or the letter "—"(long dash) to represent a horizontal slope. This indicates a curve that is
